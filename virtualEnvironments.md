# Virtual Environments

A Python Virtual Environment (venv) is created as a clean slate of libraries for one's project. A newly created venv contains only the necessary libraries, and the user may `pip install` others as required.

## Creating a new environment

An venv may be created via Command Prompt (Windows). Assuming `PATH` contains the base Python executable location, then

```shl
python -m venv <path to new venv>
```
